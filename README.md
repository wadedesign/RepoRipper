> [!CAUTION]
> Be aware that large repositories may encounter rate limits when using this script due to GitHub API restrictions. This is an inherent limitation and not a fault of the script itself.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3
* `requests` library
* `base64` library
* `dotenv` library
* `tqdm` library
* `colorama` library

**Setup:**

1. **Create a `.env` file:**
   - In the same directory as the script, create a file named `.env`.
   - Add the following line to the file, replacing the placeholder with your actual GitHub personal access token:

     ```
     GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
     ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - Open a terminal in the script's directory and run the following command:

     ```bash
     pip install requests base64 dotenv tqdm colorama
     ```

**Usage:**

1. **Run the script:**
   - Execute the script using:

     ```bash
     python3 reporipper.py https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo
     ```
2. ** Select an ouput directory:**
   - Enter -o followed by the path to the directory where you want to save the downloaded text file.

   ```bash
   python3 reporipper.py https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo -o /path/to/save/directory
   ```
3. Custom Exclusions List:
   - Enter -e followed by the path to the exclusion list file.

   ```bash
   python3 reporipper.py https://github.com/yourname/yourrepo -e /path/to/exclusion_list.txt
   ```

4. **Wait for download:**
   - The script will fetch the files and save them to a single text file in the current directory or the specified `SAVE_DIRECTORY` in the `.env` file.

**Customization:**

* You can modify the `exclusion_list.txt` file to add or remove file types and directories to be excluded by default.
* You can set the `SAVE_DIRECTORY` environment variable in the `.env` file to specify where the downloaded text file should be saved.


> [!NOTE]
>* Make sure your GitHub personal access token` has the necessary permissions to access the repository.
>* The script will skip binary or non-UTF-8 files.
>* The script will overwrite any existing file with the same name in the save directory.
